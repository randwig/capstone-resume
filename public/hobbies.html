<h1>Hobbies</h1>
<p>I enjoy playing basketball and coaching youth basketball on the weekends; also, spending time with my kids is very important.</p>
<p>I practice web development in my spare time, mostly html, css, and JavaScript.</p>
<p>I also enjoy cooking, I prepare meals for my family, and sometimes experiment with different recipes.</p>
<p>Watching NFL and NBA games is a pass time that I thouroughly enjoy. I will also watch Netflix if time permits.</p>
